## 🔬 01. Single Layer Feedforward Networks (SLFN)

### 📖 Theory

* Understand architecture of SLFNs
* Perceptron Learning Rule
* Activation functions (Step, Sigmoid)
* Limitations of SLFNs (non-linearly separable data)

📄 [Read the theory notes](./01-SLFN-Single-Layer-Feedforward-Networks/theory/SLFN_notes.md)

### 💻 Implementation

* Built a **Perceptron Model** using NumPy
* Trained on logic gates (AND, OR)
* Explored weight updates and decision boundaries

📓 [View Jupyter Notebook](./01-SLFN-Single-Layer-Feedforward-Networks/implementation/perceptron_numpy.ipynb)
